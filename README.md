# RPGBattle-BridgeDesign

This project is about applying the bridge design pattern to an RPG battle game. The Bridge pattern helps eliminate duplicate behavior by decoupling abstraction (Character) from implementation (Weapon), which promotes the Single Responsibility Principle. This approach also helps with scalability, as it reduces the required classes when making new characters or weapons.
